# Hedge_Project

Please use the included makefile to make the executable.
Included is a bash file for mass testing, (borrowed from 311 for local testing).
 - You made need to add permissions with this file using 
 ```bash 
 chmod +x runTests
 ```
Tests are in the tests file for viewing and accessed by runTests.
To use runTests after the permission is changed and the Hedge executable is created, use the command 
```bash
./runTests hedge tests
```
